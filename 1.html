<strong>The RecyclerView widget</strong> is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
<br>
In the RecyclerView model, several different components work together to display your data.<br>
The overall container for your user interface is a RecyclerView object that you add to your<br>
 layout. The RecyclerView fills itself with views provided by a layout manager that <br>
 you provide. You can use one of our standard layout managers (such as LinearLayoutManager <br>
  or GridLayoutManager), or implement your own.
